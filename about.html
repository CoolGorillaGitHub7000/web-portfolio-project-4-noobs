          Hobbies
        </ul>
        <li>
          YouTube content creation: I currently run a YouTube channel with 19
          thousand subscribers named
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CoolGorillaGoAnimate7000"
            >CoolGorillaGoAnimate7000.</a
          >
          Here, I like to make videos using an outdated Flash program named
          <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/sites/goanimate">GoAnimate.</a> What my content usually contains is characters creating
          mischief and getting grounded and punished for their misdeeds, along
          with a lazy version of those videos, where they are dumbed down and
          badly made on purpose.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cars: I don’t own a car currently because I simply don’t need one.
          Especially not in the college phase of my life. Regardless, I love to
          learn about cars and all the different brands that make them. I am a
          sucker for performance muscle cars and nimble and quirky cars with
          some pep. My favorite cars are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Mustang_(fifth_generation)">Fifth Generation Ford Mustang</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini_Hatch#Second_generation_(R56/57;_2006)">Second Generation Mini Cooper.</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          Video games: I don’t play video games as religiously as I once did,
          considering I tend to switch hobbies every few months. But video games
          still play an important role in my life. I love to sit down and play
          games my game consoles. I currently own an Xbox 360 and Series S, Sega
          Genesis, and Nintendo 3DS, Wii, and Switch. My most played video game
          of all time is Mario Kart Wii.
        </li>
        <li>
          Computers: This hobby has waned over the past few years due to
          technology advancements that do not appease me like the ChatGPT boom.
          But, I still have fun understanding how they work and what goes into
          the code of websites, applications, and operating systems. I did a
          personal project in high school a few years back where I successfully
          repaired a broken Dell Optiplex 780 desktop computer.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sports: I love to watch and play sports. Specifically, I love to play
          hockey. I have been doing it for 7 years now (or 8 seasons). I played
          at Hyland Hills in Westminster, Colorado for my youth career and just
          graduated from that last year. Now that I am ineligible for youth
          hockey, I started playing for my dad’s team and have been doing so for
          several months. Besides that, I also love to watch hockey. I follow
          the Pittsburgh Penguins. I also watch (not play) football. I
          (unfortunately) follow the Pittsburgh Steelers and Rodgers.
