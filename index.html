        Hello visitor! Welcome to my website portfolio! My name is Brian
        McShane. I am 18 years old and I currently reside in Colorado. I am
        currently going to college at Metropolitan State University located in
        Denver, Colorado. My major is <a href=https://collegekickstart.wp.drake.edu/pros-and-cons-of-an-undecided-college-major>undecided.</a>
        While I am unsure of what precise college major I want to go down the path for, I still have
        interests in computer science and business as of right now. I generally enjoy being in school and I'm rather outspoken in class. On the other hand, outside of class, I am relatively shy. I am currently working on being more comfortable around people I don't know.
      </p>
