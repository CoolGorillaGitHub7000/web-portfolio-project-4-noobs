          Mentor Interview: This semester, I am taking a business class and one
          of the long term projects is to interview a mentor for the purpose of
          getting more information on a potential major. Although I am
          undecided, I chose to interview a mentor for business as that's an
          interest I have. The interview itself was really good and I got a new
          outlook on going down the business path, including the specific paths
          in business like marketing, accounting, financing, etc. The project
          also requires a written paper and presentation, which is something I
          am still working on.

          Making This Website: Believe it or not, this is the first website I've
          ever made from scratch. I've made previous websites using Google
          Sites, but that doesn't count considering it does not involve creating
          HTML code. This website that I made involved learning how HTML and CSS
          code works in computer science class. Overall, creating this website
          wasn't too hard. Heck, I even made this project page seperate from the
          about page, which was not a requirement. I hope to learn further about
          how to make more pretty websites. This website is fine but it lacks
          personality.

          Fixing a Desktop Computer: In 10th grade, our grade was asked to do a
          Personal Project, which means that the class does a project about
          anything they're passionate about as opposed to a specific assigned
          project. For that project, I decided to buy a broken desktop computer
          and fix it, as well as upgrade it. I ended up buying a Dell Optiplex
          780 that allegedly had a power supply issue. Once I got the computer,
          I tinkered with it and I eventually got the power supply to work
          either out of sheer luck or the computer wasn't broken in the first
          place. So the fixing the computer bit didn't exactly go to plan. But I
          still upgraded it by adding RAM, an SSD, and a discrete graphics card.
          This project probably took about a few weeks as disassembly wasn't
          that hard and creating the needed PowerPoint slideshow reflection was
          easy.
