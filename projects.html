          Mentor Interview: This semester, I am taking a business class and one
          of the long term projects is to interview a mentor for the purpose of
          getting more information on a potential major. Although I am
          undecided, I chose to interview a mentor for business as that's an
          interest I have. The interview itself was really good and I got a new
          outlook on going down the business path, including the specific paths
          in business like marketing, accounting, financing, etc. The project
          also requires a written paper and presentation, which is something I
          am still working on.

          Making This Website: Believe it or not, this is the first website I've
          ever made from scratch. I've made previous websites using Google
          Sites, but that doesn't count considering it does not involve creating
          HTML code. This website that I made involved learning how HTML and CSS
          code works in computer science class. Overall, creating this website
          wasn't too hard. Heck, I even made this project page seperate from the
          about page, which was not a requirement. I hope to learn further about
          how to make more pretty websites. This website is fine but it lacks
          personality.
